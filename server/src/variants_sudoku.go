// Calculating maximum scores in Sudoku variants is complicated, since the starting values of the stacks
// are not predetermined, so we will also have to find the optimum distribution of starting values depending on
// which cards remain.
// Suits that have already at least one card played can be easily disregarded and treated similar to the usual
// variants (except that cards wrap around from 5 to 1), since their maximum progress is independent of the rest
// For all other suits, we will calculate their maximum score for each possible starting value.
// Then, we need to find a maximum-weight matching assigning starting values to the suits (where we can of course
// only pick starting values that are not used already)
// Since the resulting matchings have size at most 5, it is not worth doing a proper bipartite-matching algorithm
// here, since most instances will be trivial. Therefore, we will use the following practical approach:
//  0. Init max_score = 0
//  1. Filter out suits with known starting value, find out their maximum scores separately, add it to max_score
//  2. For each suit, calculate {m1, ..., m5} as the maximum score for this suit if we start the suit at 1,...,5
//  3. Filter out each suit with {m1, ..., m5} = {5,...,5}. For each, add 5 to max_score
//     Note that OPT = 5 + OPT(subinstance), since we can just assign these suits arbitrarily
//  4. Solve the remaining subinstance, assigning the remaining suits to the possible starting values with
//     the computed weight {m1, ..., m5}
//     We will do this by brute-force, which will be at most 120 possibilities to check, although in actual games,
//     we will probably never have to do this, since for most of the suits, we should have one copy of each card
//     or known starting value, in which case they will be filtered out in step 2 or 3 already.
