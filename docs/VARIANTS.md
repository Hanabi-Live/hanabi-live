# Variants

Hanabi Live is programmed by Hanabi enthusiasts who have played thousands of games. In order to keep the game fresh, the server allows you to create games using the variants mentioned in the [rules that come with the game](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Rules.md#multicolor-variants) as well as many other non-official custom variants. Players also have the ability to further custom a game by using a number of [custom game options](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-live/blob/master/docs/FEATURES.md#custom-game-options).

* For example, if the first clue of the game is a color clue, then the second clue must be a number clue, the third clue must be a color clue, and so forth.

### Clue Starved

* Each discard only generates 0.5 clues. (The team still starts with 8 clues.)

* This variant was invented by [Sean McCarthy on the BoardGameGeek forums](https://boardgamegeek.com/article/30863162).
* Two 1's are removed from each suit.
* One "START" card is added to each suit.
* When a stack is empty, you can play either a 1, a 5, or a START card on it.
* When a stack has a START card on it, you can play either a 2 or a 4 on it.
* If a stack was started with a 1 (or a START + 2), then it works as a normal stack.
* If a stack was started with a 5 (or a START + 4), then it must be completed in reverse.
* A clue token is given when a stack is completed, regardless of whether it is a normal stack or a reversed stack.

### Cow & Pig

* When players give a clue, they point at the cards clued, but say "moo" if it a color clue and "oink" if it is a rank clue.

### Duck

* This variant was invented by Jack Gurev's group.
* When players give a clue, they point at the cards clued, but say "quack" instead of a color or number.

### Throw It in a Hole

* This variant was invented by Jack Gurev's group.
* When players play a card, they do not flip it over like normal but instead place it face down in the center of the table.
* The score of the game is not revealed until the game is over.
* Players do not get a clue back for successfully playing a 5.
* The game will automatically end if 3 strikes are accumulated.
