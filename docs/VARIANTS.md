# Variants

[Hanabi Live](https://hanabi.live) is programmed by Hanabi enthusiasts who have played the game thousands of times. In order to keep the game fresh, the server allows you to create games using the variants mentioned in the [rules that come with the game](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Rules.md#multicolor-variants) as well as many other non-official custom variants. Players also have the ability to further custom a game by using a number of [custom game options](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-live/blob/master/docs/FEATURES.md#custom-game-options).

## Detailed Rules per Variant

  * Blue
  * Green
  * Yellow
  * Red
  * Purple

### 6 Suits

* A teal suit is added.
* It works identical to the other suits in that you can clue teal cards with teal clues.
* (This is the first [official variant](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Rules.md#multicolor-variants).)

### 4 Suits

* The purple suit is removed.

### 3 Suits

* The yellow and purple suits are removed.

### Black

* One of the suits is replaced with a black suit.
* It works similar to the other suits in that you can clue black cards with black clues.
* There is only one of each black card in the deck, which means that every black card is "critical".
* (This is the second [official variant](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Rules.md#multicolor-variants).)

### Rainbow

* One of the suits is replaced with a rainbow suit.
* All color clues will "touch" the rainbow suit.

### Special Suit Combinations (e.g. Black & Rainbow)

* Fives have the property of the suit prefix. For example, rainbow-fives are "touched" by all colors.

### Suit-Ones or Suit-Fives with Another Special Suit

* Two 1's are removed from the reversed suit.
* Two 5's are added to the reversed suit.
* The "White Reversed (6 Suits)" variant is an official variant introduced with [Hanabi Grands Feux](https://www.cocktailgames.com/jeu/hanabi-grands-feux/) under the name "Poudre Noire" (Black Powder).

* When a stack is empty, you can play either a 1, a 5, or a START card on it.
* When a stack has a START card on it, you can play either a 2 or a 4 on it.
* If a stack was started with a 1 (or a START + 2), then it works as a normal stack.
* If a stack was started with a 5 (or a START + 4), then it must be completed in reverse.
* A clue token is given when a stack is completed, regardless of whether it is a normal stack or a reversed stack.
* This variant was invented by [Sean McCarthy on the BoardGameGeek forums](https://boardgamegeek.com/article/30863162).
