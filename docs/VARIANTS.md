# Variants

Hanabi Live is programmed by Hanabi enthusiasts who have played thousands of games. In order to keep the game fresh, the server allows you to create games using several custom variants. Beyond this, players also have the ability to further custom a game by using a number of [custom game options](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-live/blob/master/docs/FEATURES.md#custom-game-options).

<br />

### No Variant

* This is the "base" game, with 5 suits. Unlike some real-life versions of the game, Hanabi Live uses the following five suit colors:
  * Blue
  * Green
  * Yellow
  * Red
  * Purple

### Six Suits

* An teal suit is added.
* It works identical to the other suits in that you can clue teal cards with teal clues.

### Four Suits

* The purple suit is removed.

### Three Suits

* The red and purple suits are removed.

### White

* One of the suits is replaced with a white suit.
* No color clues "touch" the white suit. (It is a colorless suit.)

### Black

* One of the suits is replaced with a black suit.
* It works similar to the other suits in that you can clue black cards with black clues.
* There is only one of each black card in the deck, which means that every black card is "critical".

### Rainbow

* One of the suits is replaced with a rainbow suit.
* All color clues will "touch" the rainbow suit.

### Gray (White + Black)

* One of the suits is replaced with a gray suit.
* No color clues "touch" the gray suit. (It is a colorless suit.)
* There is only one of each gray card in the deck, which means that every gray card is "critical".

### Dark Rainbow (Black + Rainbow)

* One of the suits is replaced with a dark rainbow suit.
* All color clues will "touch" the dark rainbow suit.
* There is only one of each dark rainbow card in the deck, which means that every dark rainbow card is "critical".

### Color Blind

* Color clues touch no suits. (Empty color clues are always allowed.)

### Ambiguous

* Two suits share a color. There is no way to disambiguate between them with color clues.

### Very Ambiguous

* Three suits share a color. There is no way to disambiguate between them with color clues.

### Dual-Color

* Each suit is touched by two separate colors.

### Multi-Fives

* Fives are "touched" by all rank clues.
* Players cannot clue rank 5.

### Clue Starved

* Each discard only generates 0.5 clues. (The team still starts with 8 clues.)

### Up or Down

* This variant was invented by [Sean McCarthy on the BoardGameGeek forums](https://boardgamegeek.com/article/30863162).
* Two 1's are removed from each suit.
* One "START" card is added to each suit.
* When a stack is empty, you can play either a 1, a 5, or a START card on it.
* When a stack has a START card on it, you can play either a 2 or a 4 on it.
* If a stack was started with a 1 (or a START + 2), then it works as a normal stack.
* If a stack was started with a 5 (or a START + 4), then it must be completed in reverse.
* A clue token is given when a stack is completed, regardless of whether it is a normal stack or a reversed stack.

### Duck

* This variant was invented by Jack Gurev's group.
* When players give a clue, they point at the cards clued, but say "quack" instead of a color or number.

### African American

* This is a mix of several variants. The suits are as follows:
  1. Tomato (red)
  2. Mahogany (red)
  3. White (colorless)
  4. Sky (blue)
  3. Navy (blue)
  6. Black (one of each)

### Wild & Crazy

* This is a mix of several variants. The suits are as follows:
  1. Green (blue / yellow)
  2. Purple (blue / red)
  3. Orange (yellow / red)
  4. White (colorless)
  5. Rainbow (all colors)
  6. Black (one of each)
