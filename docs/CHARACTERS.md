# Detrimental Character Assignments

* On Hanabi Live, "Detrimental Character Assignments" can be enabled for a game, which restrict players in additional ways beyond the normal rules.
* These characters are loosly based on [this post](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1688194/hanabi-characters-variant) from Sean McCarthy on the Board Game Geek forums.
