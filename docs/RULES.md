# Rules

<br />

## Overview

* Hanab is a card game based on logic and deduction.
* Unlike other card games, it is cooperative, meaning that everyone either wins or loses together.
* Unlike other card games, you cannot see your own hand, but you can see the hands of the other players.
* There is a deck of 50 cards comprised of 5 colors and numbers 1 through 5.
* The goal is to play the cards for each color in order (e.g. 1 through 5), kind of like [Solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire)).

<br />

## The Setup

* In a 2-player or 3-player game, each player is dealt 5 cards.
* In a 3-player or 4-player game, each player is dealt 4 cards.
* In a 6-player game, each player is dealt 3 cards.
* The team always starts off with 8 clue tokens.
* The play stacks for each color are located in the center of the table. All players play their cards on to the shared play stacks. To start off with, nothing is played on the play stacks.
* The discard pile is located off to the side. All players discard their cards to the shared discard pile. To start off with, no cards are discarded.
* A random player goes first.

<br />

## Actions

* Play rotates clockwise around the table, with each player performing one action.
* There are 3 possible actions that each player can perform:

<br />

### 1) Play a Card

* A player can pick any card from their hand and attempt to play it. (They do not need to know exactly what the card is.)
* If it is the next card for any of the five colors, it gets played onto that pile.
* If the card is not playable, then it goes to the discard pile. (See "Misplays" below.)

<br />

### 2) Discard a Card

* A player can pick any card from their hand and discard it. (They do not need to know exactly what the card is.)
* The card goes to the discard pile and the team gets an additional clue.
* Players are not allowed to discard if the team has 8 clue tokens available.

<br />

### 3) Give a Clue

* A player can spend a clue token to give one "clue" to another player.
* To give a clue:
  * First, you choose a player.
  * Second, you choose either a number or color.
  * Then, you tell that player about all of the cards in their hand that match that number or color.
* It is not allowed to give a clue that matches 0 cards in the hand.

#### Example

* For example, if a player's hand is as follows, from left-to-right:
  * red 1, red 3, blue 3, green 4
* Then, the possible clues that a player could give to that hand would be as follows:
  * "The first two cards are red."
  * "The third card is blue."
  * "The fourth card is green."
  * "The first card is a 1."
  * "The middle two cards are 3s."
  * "The fourth card is a 4."

<br />

## Misplays

* If a player attempts to play a card that is not playable, that is referred to as a misplay.
* Misplayed cards go to the discard pile instead of the play stacks.
* Unlike a normal discard, the team is not awarded a clue when a misplay happens.
* When a misplay happens, the team gets one strike.
* If the team gets 3 strikes, the game immediately ends and the team is given a score of 0 points.

<br />

## The Deck

* The deck consists of 50 cards.
* There are 5 colors (e.g. suits). Each color has:
  * Three 1s
  * Two 2s
  * Two 3s
  * Two 4s
  * One 5
* It is important for players to keep in mind how many copies of each card there are - if all copies of a card are discarded, then the team can no longer score a perfect score.

<br />

## The End of the Game

* The end of the game is triggered when the last card of the deck is drawn. When that happens, everybody gets one more turn (including the player who drew the last card).
  * This means that the bottom card of the deck is able to be played, but nothing is able to be played on top of it.
* If the team gets to the end of the game successfully, they get one point for each card that they successfully played.
  * It will take a team of new players many tries before they can reach the top scores.
  * Experienced players will always be aiming for the maximum score.

<br />

## Other Rules

* Successfully playing a 5 gives the team an additional clue. (This is a "reward" for finishing a play stack.)
* If you finish a play stack while the team is at 8 clues, then the extra clue is forfeit.
