 * connection with the cookie. (This is done implicitly because JavaScript will automatically use
 * any current cookies for the website when establishing a WebSocket connection.) So, before
 * allowing anyone to open a WebSocket connection, we need to validate the cookie and the user ID.
 * If the checks pass, we queue the login work (to i.e. send them their game history and so on).
