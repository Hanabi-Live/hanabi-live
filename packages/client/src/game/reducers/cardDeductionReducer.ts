   * Start with the more stable possibilities. This is for performance. It seemed to have a
   * measurable difference. The `possibilityValid` method will short-circuit if it finds a branch
   * that is impossible or if it finds a possibility that is valid. Here's an example:
   *
   * ```ts
   * deckPossibilities = [
   *   [red 5 or yellow 5],
   *   [green or blue],
   *   [green or blue],
   *   [green or blue],
   *   [red 5],
   * ]
   * ```
   *
   * `possibilityValid` would initially start with the first card being red 5. It would then check
   * about 1000 combinations of the next three cards before finding each one is impossible at the
   * very end of each combination. If we reorder that to:
   *
   * ```ts
   * deckPossibilities=[
   *   [red 5],
   *   [red 5 or yellow 5],
   *   [green or blue],
   *   [green or blue],
   *   [green or blue],
   * ]
   * ```
   *
   * Then when it attempts to resolve [red 5 or yellow 5] to red 5, it will realize that's
   * impossible and short-circuit that branch (not checking the next 1000 combinations of the next 3
   * cards). It would switch to checking if the combination would work when [red 5 or yellow 5]
   * resolves to yellow 5 (by finding a combination of the next 3 cards that fit). So it should get
   * to a fitting combination quicker or find that there is no fitting combination quicker. This
   * applies to more than just cards that have one possibility (such as red 5 in the example).
