- remove type assertions from lobby + views
- redo install instructions without choco
- refactor START_CARD_RANK from 7 --> 0 (might affect database?)
- search for "This message is unnecessary"
- search for "TODO: remove. This is unused"
- delete UIGlobals.activePlayerIndex

waiting to hear back:
- remove type assertions from sudoku.ts (need feedback from Ram)

short term:
- refactor soundTypeForLastAction (should probably delete the whole thing)
- move "build_client.sh" and "esbuild_dev.sh" out of "client" directory
- get rid of all identity functions in "packages/client/src/game/rules/variant.ts"
- refactor `ignoreNegative`, I don't think it should be created inside of the reducer

long term once the server is rewritten in TypeScript:
- change server WebSocket authentication style: https://github.com/Hanabi-Live/hanabi-live/issues/2845
  - once this is done, we don't have to use client-side cookies anymore, can remove `@fastify/secure-session` dep entirely
  - will also have to generate argon2 hash on client side so that the hash can be stored in local storage
- delete "metadata" table from "database_schema.sql" + "test_key" thing
- refactor chat_log to have foreign key for user_id + boolean for server message
- refactor ActionNoteList to be one array of objects instead of multiple arrays (and the other various note things)
- refactor `order` --> `cardOrder`
- stronger typing for `disconShadowingSeat` field
- remove -1 type from activePlayerIndex (prefer undefined)
