- see "function httpWSError" - will this leak memory? test it
- test if getting a database error disconnects other existing websocket users
- test that a field annotated as z.date() actually works on the client
- fix server disconnect in "wsQueue.ts" to match "websocket_disconnect.go"

- remove type assertions from lobby + views
- refactor START_CARD_RANK from 7 --> 0 (might affect database?)
- delete UIGlobals.activePlayerIndex

short term:
- move "build_client.sh" and "esbuild_dev.sh" out of "client" directory
- refactor `ignoreNegative`, I don't think it should be created inside of the reducer (?)

long term once the server is rewritten in TypeScript:
- linking to lobby table that doesn't exist shouldn't throw warning and should instead just redirect to /
- make Connection.send on client type-safe
- remove all null in @hanabi-live/game (this might need server changes)
- server should send message about if this is the player's first initial load, then we can use that in the soundView.ts to not play the initial sound effect on first turn refresh
- change server WebSocket authentication style: https://github.com/Hanabi-Live/hanabi-live/issues/2845
  - once this is done, we don't have to use client-side cookies anymore, can remove `@fastify/secure-session` dep entirely
  - will also have to generate argon2 hash on client side so that the hash can be stored in local storage
- delete "metadata" table from "database_schema.sql" + "test_key" thing
- refactor chat_log to have foreign key for user_id + boolean for server message
- refactor ActionNoteList to be one array of objects instead of multiple arrays (and the other various note things)
- refactor `order` --> `cardOrder`
- stronger typing for `disconShadowingSeat` field
- remove -1 type from activePlayerIndex (prefer undefined)
- separate sign up and login into two separate forms
- rename ServerCommandUserData.user --> ServerCommandUserData.username
- rename serverCommandTableData.players --> serverCommandTableData.playerNames
- change spectator.shadowingPlayerIndex from -1 to undefined
- change spectator.shadowingPlayerPregameIndex from -1 to undefined
- change spectator.name --> username
- rename disconSpectatingTable + disconShadowingSeat
- refactor location of CharacterAssignment interface
- shadowingPlayerIndex: playerIndex.or(z.literal(-1)).optional(), --> get rid of -1
- search for "=== -1" and "!== -1"
- remove incrementNumGames, make dedicated `gameHistorySingle` command
- delete hanab.code-workspace
