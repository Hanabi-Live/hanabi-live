-- A table's chat names its table in `table_id`, which `room` stores as "table" followed by the ID.
-- This batch covers the IDs from 64,000,000 to 64,999,999, at most about 1 million of the 32
-- million rows, in steps of 50,000 IDs. A pause after each step leaves the disk to live queries for
-- most of the time. The server never changes a table's archived chat, so the locks that the batch
-- holds until it commits block nothing.
