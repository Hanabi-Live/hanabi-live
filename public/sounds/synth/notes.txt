To make more beeps that sound consistent, go to websynths.com and load hanabi.websynths-patch.json (the "load patch" button).

If that does not work, try to recreate it by doing this:
* elect "025: elise"
* set "maximum sustain time" in the middle to 0.2
* set "release part 3" below that to 0.5
* set "reverb mix" on the right to 2
